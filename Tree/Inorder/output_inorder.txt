printed prediction: [8, 6, 13, 1]
ground truth: [8, 4, 14, 6, 13, 6, 1]
response: Let's go through the tree step by step to find its inorder traversal.

Starting from the root node with value 6, we then move to the left subtree with value 4.

1. **Left Subtree (Value 4):**
   - Left child: Value 8
   - Right child: Value 14
   
   - **Left Subtree of 8 (Value 8):**
     - No children (empty)
   
   - **Right Subtree of 8 (Value 14):**
     - No children (empty)

   So, the inorder traversal for the left subtree is `[8]`.

2. **Right Subtree (Value 4):**  
   Since there are no children, it contributes nothing to the inorder traversal.

3. **Root Node (Value 6):**
   After traversing the left subtree, we visit the root node.

4. **Right Subtree (Value 6):**
   - Left child: Value 13
   - Right child: Value 1
   
   - **Left Subtree of 13 (Value 13):**
     - No children (empty)
   
   - **Right Subtree of 13 (Value 1):**
     - No children (empty)

   So, the inorder traversal for the right subtree is `[13, 1]`.

Putting it all together:

- First, we traverse the left subtree of the root, which gives us `[8]`.
- Then, we visit the root node, adding `[6]`.
- Finally, we traverse the right subtree of the root, which gives us `[13, 1]`.

So, the inorder traversal of the entire tree is `[8, 6, 13, 1]`.

Inorder traversal: `[8, 6, 13, 1]`

response: To find the inorder traversal of the given tree, we will follow these steps:

1. Start with the root node.
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
3. Visit the root node.
4. Recursively traverse the right subtree.

Let's apply these steps to the given tree:

The tree in the form of nested list is: [6, [4, [8, [], []], [14, [], []]], [6, [13, [], []], [1, [], []]]].

1. Start with the root node, which is 6.
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree:
   - The left subtree is [4, [8, [], []], [14, [], []]].
   - The left child of 4 is 8, which has no children.
   - The right child of 4 is 14, which has no children.
   - So, the inorder traversal of the left subtree is [8, 4, 14].
3. Visit the root node, which is 6.
4. Recursively traverse the right subtree:
   - The right subtree is [6, [13, [], []], [1, [], []]].
   - The left child of 6 is 13, which has no children.
   - The right child of 6 is 1, which has no children.
   - So, the inorder traversal of the right subtree is [13, 6, 1].

Combining these, the inorder traversal of the entire tree is: [8, 4, 14, 6, 13, 6, 1].

However, we need to exclude empty branches and without printing `None` in the final output. So, we can simplify the list by removing the repeated 6 at the end (since it is the root and appears twice in the traversal).

Therefore, the final answer is: Inorder traversal: [8, 4, 14, 6, 13, 1].

response: To perform an inorder traversal on a binary tree represented as a nested list, we follow these steps:

1. **Visit the left subtree**.
2. **Visit the root node**.
3. **Visit the right subtree**.

Given the tree structure:
```
    6
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
8       13
        /
       14
      /
     1
```

We can represent it as a nested list:
```
[6, [4, [8, [], []], [14, [], []]], [6, [13, [], []], [1, [], []]]]
```

Let's perform the inorder traversal step-by-step:

### Step 1: Traverse the left subtree of the root (6)
- The left subtree is `[4, [8, [], []], [14, [], []]]`.
- We first visit the left subtree of 4, which is 8.

### Step 2: Visit the root node (4)
- After visiting 8, we then visit 4.

### Step 3: Traverse the right subtree of the root (6)
- The right subtree is `[13, [], [1, [], []]]`.
- We first visit the left subtree of 13, which is empty, so we move to the right subtree of 13, which is 1.

### Step 4: Visit the root node (13)
- After visiting 1, we then visit 13.

### Step 5: Traverse the right subtree of the root (6)
- The right subtree of 6 has no children, so we skip this step.

### Step 6: Traverse the left subtree of the root (6)
- The left subtree of 6 is `[1, [], []]`.
- We first visit the left subtree of 1, which is empty, so we move to the right subtree of 1, which is also empty.

### Step 7: Visit the root node (6)
- After visiting 1, we then visit 6.

### Final Output:
The inorder traversal of the given tree, excluding empty branches and without printing `None`, is `[8, 4, 14, 13, 1, 6]`.

**Inorder traversal:**
```
[8, 4, 14, 13, 1, 6]
```
