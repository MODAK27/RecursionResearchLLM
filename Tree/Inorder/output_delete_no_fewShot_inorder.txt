This code defines a `Node` class for the tree nodes and a `Tree` class for the tree itself. The `Tree` class has a method `inorder_traversal` that performs the inorder traversal and returns the result as a list. The `print_inorder` method then prints the result.

This code defines a class `BinaryTree` with a method `inorder_traversal` that recursively traverses the tree in the order of left subtree, root, and then right subtree. The method returns a list of integers representing the inorder traversal of the tree, excluding any empty branches.
