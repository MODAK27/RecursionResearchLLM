response: To perform a preorder traversal on the given binary tree, we'll follow these steps:

1. Visit the root node.
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the preorder function.
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the preorder function.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def preorder_traversal(node):
    if node is None:
        return []
    
    # Step 1: Visit the root node
    result = [node]
    
    # Step 2: Traverse the left subtree
    if 'left' in node:
        result += preorder_traversal(node['left'])
    
    # Step 3: Traverse the right subtree
    if 'right' in node:
        result += preorder_traversal(node['right'])
    
    return result

# Given binary tree as a nested list
tree = [6, [18, [20, [], []], [14, [], []]], [14, [19, [], []], [5, [], []]]]

# Convert the nested list to the required format (assuming each element is a dictionary with 'value', 'left', and 'right' keys)
tree_dict = {}
current_node = tree_dict
for value in tree:
    current_node['value'] = value
    if isinstance(value, list):
        current_node['left'] = {}
        current_node['right'] = {}
        current_node = current_node['left']
    else:
        current_node = current_node['right']

# Perform preorder traversal
preorder_result = preorder_traversal(tree_dict)

print("PreOrder traversal:", preorder_result)
```

This code first converts the given nested list into a dictionary structure that represents the binary tree, where each node is a dictionary containing 'value', 'left', and 'right' keys. Then it performs the preorder traversal using a recursive function and prints the result. 

Please note that the conversion from the nested list to the dictionary structure assumes that the input is correctly formatted and that each node's children are either `None` or another list representing their children. If the input is not structured this way, additional error checking would be necessary.
